Negative Testing (Verify the Block)
This test confirms that your security rule is successfully blocking traffic from the restricted VLAN (VLAN 40) to the Server.

Test from a PC in VLAN 40 (IT-Admin)
Check L3 Connectivity (Ping/ICMP)

PC: Select a PC in VLAN 40.

Tool: Open the Command Prompt (Desktop â†’ Command Prompt).

Command: Ping the Server's IP address:

ping 192.168.90.2
Expected Result (SUCCESS): The ping must FAIL. You should see Request timed out or Destination Host Unreachable.

Conclusion: If the ping fails, the ACL is correctly blocking the ICMP protocol (Layer 3).
